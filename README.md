Given real-world scenarios to build a queuing system, I use the knowledge of hardware specifications to identify which hardware types work best, and then test the application using the Intel® DevCloud.

## Project Overview

1. Proposed a possible hardware solution
2. Built out the person detection application and tested its performance on the DevCloud using multiple hardware types
3. Compared the performance to see which hardware performed best
4. Revised the primal proposal based on the test results

## The Scenarios

Three different scenarios that depict real-world problems based on different sectors where edge devices are typically deployed.

**Scenario 1: Manufacturing Sector**
[scenarios/manufacturing.md](scenario/manufacturing.md)

**Scenario 2: Retail Sector**
[scenarios/retail.md](scenarios/retail.md)

**Scenario 3: Transportation Sector**
[scenarios/transportation.md](scenarios/transportation.md)

## Deployment and Development steps

* Step 1: Create the Python Script
* Step 2: Create the Job Submission Script
* Step 3: Manufacturing Scenario
* Step 4: Retail Scenario
* Step 5: Transportation Scenario

## Built With

* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) - Open Source Computer Vision Library
*  [OpenVINO](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/) - Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit
* [DevCloud](https://devcloud.intel.com/edge/) - Intel® DevCloud - Intel® Developer Zone
